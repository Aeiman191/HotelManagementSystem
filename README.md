# HotelManagementSystem

OOP project in C++ for Hotel Management. Implements reservation, check-in, and utilizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for efficient organization and management.

## Overview

This C++ project implements an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Hotel Management System. It employs classes for rooms, customers, dates, times, floors, and the hotel. The system facilitates room reservation and check-in, allowing users to specify room types and stay duration. It utilizes OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for efficient organization and functionality.

## Features

- Room reservation and check-in functionality.
- Class-based structure for managing rooms, customers, dates, times, floors, and the hotel.
- Utilizes OOP principles for code organization, including encapsulation, inheritance, and
  polymorphism.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable to access the Hotel Management System.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to reserve or check-in to rooms.

## Classes

_Room_: Represents individual hotel rooms with properties like type, availability, price, and status.

_Date_: Manages date-related operations for check-in and check-out.

_Time_: Handles time-related functionality for check-in and check-out times.

_Floor_: Represents hotel floors and includes an array of rooms.

_Customer_: Manages customer information, reservation details, and check-in/check-out times.

_Hotel_: Orchestrates the overall functionality and includes an array of floors.

Note
This project serves as a basic template for a hotel management system and can be extended for more features and improvements.
